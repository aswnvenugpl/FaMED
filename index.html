       <h4> What is the Privacy Policy and what
        does it cover?</h4>
        Effective from 24 April 2023<br>
        We at FaMED want you to understand what information we collect, and
        how we use and share it. That's why we encourage you to read our Privacy
        Policy. This helps you use FaMED in the way that's right for you <br>
        In the Privacy Policy, we explain how we collect and use information. We
        also let you know your rights<br>
        <h4>Personal Identification Information</h4>
        FaMED may collect personal identification information from Users in a
        variety of ways, including but not limited to, when Users register on the
        App, fill out a form within the App, and in connection with other activities,
        services, features, or resources we make available on our App. Users may
        be asked for, as appropriate, name, email address, mailing address, phone
        number, and health information. Users may, however, visit our App
        anonymously. We will collect personal identification information from
        Users only if they voluntarily submit such information to us. Users can
        always refuse to supply personal identification information, except that it
        may prevent them from engaging in certain App-related activities.<br>
        <h4>Non-Personal Identification Information</h4>
        We may collect non-personal identification information about Users
        whenever they interact with our App. Non-personal identification
        information may include the browser name, the type of device and
        technical information about Users' means of connection to our App, such
        as the operating system and the Internet service providers utilized and
        other similar information.<br>
        <h4> How we use collected information</h4>
        FaMED may collect and use personal information from Users for the
        following purposes:<br>
        To personalize User experience: We may use information in the aggregate
        to understand how our Users as a group use the services and resources
        provided on our App.<br>
        To improve our App: We continually strive to improve our App offerings
        based on the information and feedback we receive from you.
        To process transactions: We may use the information Users provide about
        themselves to provide service to that order. We do not share this
        information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to
        provide the service.<br>
        To send periodic emails: We may use the email address to send User
        information and updates pertaining to their order or use of the App. It
        may also be used to respond to their inquiries, questions, and/or other
        requests.<br>
        
        <h4>Sharing Your Personal Information</h4>
        We do not sell, trade, or rent Users' personal identification information to
        others. We may share generic aggregated demographic information not
        linked to any personal identification information regarding visitors and
        users with our business partners, trusted affiliates, and advertisers for
        the purposes outlined above.<br>
        <h4>Data Security</h4>
        We take appropriate measures to safeguard Users' personal information
        against unauthorized access, theft, loss, or alteration. We adopt
        appropriate data collection, storage, and processing practices and
        security measures to protect against unauthorized access, alteration,
        disclosure, or destruction of your personal information, username,
        password, transaction information, and data stored on our App.

        the updated date at the bottom of this page. We encourage Users to
        frequently check this page for any changes to stay informed about how
